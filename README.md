# Weekly Data Viz

In December 2020, I took a 'Data Visualization as Activism' workshop through [Pioneer Works](https://pioneerworks.org/), taught by artist + technologist [Sam Lavigne](https://lav.io/). 

In this workshop, we were asked to interogate data, or rather, how it's presented. 

 It really got me thinking about how data is typically visualized - clean lines, minimalist color pallets, minimal text, following [a long tradition in infographics + data visualizations](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/surprising-history-infographic-180959563/). Data visualization has informed political movements, public health campaigns, migration patterns. This minimalist aesthetic, I suppose, it meant to convey some sort of objectivity. But how the data is gathered (whether it is gathered), who gathers it, the tools that are used during this process- all contain some bias, whether perceptible or not. And so, one of the key takeaways for me was to reimagine how to represent data in a way that goes beyond the sleek minimalist aesthetic, to really interrogate what exactly the data I want to represent means. 

 Sure, this might be a more...artistic approach than what many data scientists/engineers are comfortable with. I recognize that. These tend to fall into descriptive visualizations rather than trying to perform mathematical analysis. 
 
 But I guess I'm interested in following the threads to where engineering/technology bleeds into speculative design. What if things were different?
